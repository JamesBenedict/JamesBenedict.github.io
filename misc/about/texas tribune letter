There are a few organizations which demonstrate more comittment to accountablity journalism than the Tribune. Growing up in the 2000's I watched institutions act with immunity as they harmed the public and enriched themselves. I could have became a cynic, but instead I became a journalist to address what I saw was wrong with the world directly. 

I lead a data anylsis of campaign contributions in Indiana from 2000-2015, which accounted for nearly a billion dollars raised. One thing that startled me was the amount of out-of-state money raised for local elections. If Georgia's recent special election is any indicator, this trend is only going to increase. 

I would appreciate covering this subject more in Texas. I would build an interactive data explorer that has: 
	-a map showing the sum of money coming from each state per year since 2010. 
	-Canidates who recieved the most money from out of state contributions. I would want to compare how much they get from out and in state.
