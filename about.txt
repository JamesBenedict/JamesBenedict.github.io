tl;dr Journalist who <3 computers would build cool stuff for you

All the way back to my microsoft paint days I've been using computers to try and impress people. While I still long for those days of artistic liberity, now I'm making more functional graphics for news orgnizations.

I'm working at the invesitagtions desk at the Indiana Daily Student focusing on campus crime. I've also have a soft spot for health reporting. I like interviewing data but love finding the most inuative way to display it. 

I like taking things apart and then seeing how I can put them back differently (I still feel bad for some of my sister's barbies). Check out some of the more recent result below or on my

<p>We should probably get this out of the way, if you call me with an offer I might respond by mimicking an airhorn. During the interview if you get me talking about something I like you might need me to slow down to understand every word. I'm an excitable person who is having a great time learning how to make better graphics.</p>

<p>I've never been good at staying satsified with my current understanding of technology. I must have given myself half a dozen heart attacks learning how to jailbreak my phone or messing with my computer's BIOS, but I love the rush of discovery. I promise if you let me into your system I won't break anything but I might annoy you with how many questions I ask.</p>

<p>While soon I might be techincally done with my schooling, I am far from being done with my education. I hope wherever I end up pushes me so I can keep leaning better analyis and visulization methods. I hope to create as clean and intuative of a process as I can.</p>
